No master key was found. The server will accept unidentified requests.

A master key of at least 16 bytes will be required when switching to a production environment.


We generated a new secure master key for you (you can safely use this token):

>> --master-key Q6wDnDX4s4PXS8fFpxAYsXxNKlYfO62KN9f0vKCLjSk <<

Restart Meilisearch with the argument above to use this new and secure master key.
